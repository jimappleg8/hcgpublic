// step 1: determine the "recipe factor" (new servings/reference servings)
//
// step 2: calculate new ingredient amount based on reference units
//
// step 3: determine best units for new measurement


function scale_volume()
{
// cups, tbsp, tsp, l, ml, dl, fluid oz, pint, quart, gallon

}


function scale_weight()

// lbs, oz, g, kg
