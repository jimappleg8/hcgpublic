Public Domain
-------------

The ewiki+ distribution for the most part is Public Domain. This means
that you can absolutely freely use, modify and redistribute it and any
parts of it. No rules, no restrictions, not even attribution enforced.

That's why you could apply your license of choice (be it the GNU GPL,
LGPL, BSD or MIT/X11, MPL, QPL, PHP, Perl, CDDL, Artistic, MSFT EULA,
AGPL, SISSL, IBM CPL, Apache, ASDL or so) to it and distribute and use
it further under that's conditions. The Public Domain status of this
original package doesn't affect or hinder you in any way thereby.


Exceptions
----------

Parts of the distributed tarball however fall under different licenses,
namely:

| plugins/auth-liveuser/ | GNU Lesser General Public License, 2.1+,   |
|                        | a PEAR class library, http://pear.php.net/ |

Our "extra tarball", btw, also contains source code from different
projects and regularily under different licenses.
