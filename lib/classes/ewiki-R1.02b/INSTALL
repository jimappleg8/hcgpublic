Information on how to install and use ErfurtWiki can be found in the
README, this file only contains notes for the impatient:

Quick Test Installation
=======================

- just move this newly extracted directory into your webservers docroot:
  mv ewiki-R1.02i /var/www/wiki

- then edit the "config.php" file, you may need to set the correct
  parameters to access your MySQL database server (db user name and
  password, and select a database different from "test")

- if you don't have MySQL, then ewiki will simply fall back to use a
  flat file backend that stores its pages in "/tmp" until you configure
  something real (constant EWIKI_DBFILES_DIRECTORY)

- just go to http://localhost/wiki/
  (or whereever you did put the files)


Real Setup
==========

If you don't want to go through the [README] files to find out about all
possible features, then the 'setup.php' wizard script will help you to
generate a custom 'config.php' script.
