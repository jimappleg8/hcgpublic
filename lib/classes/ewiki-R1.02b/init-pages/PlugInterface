! A general pluginterface

The main [PHP|http://php.net/] script of ErfurtWiki contains everything
necessary to run a wiki site (except the html around which make up your
sites` layout). However at some point of its development the extensions
got too large to be included into the core without hurting speed. So from
now non-essential but powerful extensions can be added (using just PHPs
include() statement) into the engine through the new __pluginterface__,
which is surprisingly just a simple array structure listing the
extension functions.

Please see the [README.plugins], [README.programming] or ErfurtWiki:ListOfPluginHooks
for a complete plugin list and more informations about this.


! The mpi plugins

Another extension are the MpiPlugins which themselves utilize the general
pluginterface to chain into the page transformation process to extend them
with dynamically generated content.
