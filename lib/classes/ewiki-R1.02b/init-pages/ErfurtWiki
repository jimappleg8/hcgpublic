ErfurtWiki is a WikiWikiWeb implementation in the PHP scripting
language and mainly contained in one script file. It is PublicDomain
(''you are free''). It was implemented more like a library and thus
allows very quick integration into existing web sites, also because
it does not enforce a specific page layout or requires you to choose
from a few factory page themes/skins.

See the FeatureList or SoftwareNotes for what it can do. Or find out
more about it at [ErfurtWiki:] or http://ewiki.berlios.de/ (where
you could also get your own, using the very simple
[http://ewiki.berlios.de/installer/ WebInstaller]).

There are also hundreds of other implementations available. You can
find out about them on the large WardsWiki:WikiEngines list or using
the [http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/WikiEngine WikiFeatures:WikiEngine]
comparision table (though still incomplete).
