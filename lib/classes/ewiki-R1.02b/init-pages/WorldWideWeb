The most well-known internet service is the WWW, which is a Hypertext system built upon the HyperTextTransferProtocol and the HyperTextMarkupLanguage.

WikiWikiWeb is a Hypertext system, but implemented as just one application of the WWW service itself (utilizing the already existing technical basis).
Contributing to a Wiki is not as complicated as creating and maintaining a www page (with all the additionally software and services which were necessary for that).
