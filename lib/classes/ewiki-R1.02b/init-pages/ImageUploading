Most wiki software allows to include references to image files located on
some remote WorldWideWeb server. ErfurtWiki permits this too, but it can
additionally caches those referenced images, because of its database
design.

This feature also allowed to implement a very easy to use image uploading
function, which can be used to insert images into a page while you edit
it (just see EditThisPage). This is usually allowed for all users
and thus is likely to grow the sites` content very quickly, not only in
means of text pieces, but instead more multimedia like.
