This is a list of rather often asked questions, together with answers of
course. It has been compiled from our MailingList, SupportForum and years
of experience with user frustration. :)


When I edit a page, ugly BACKSLASHES \ \\ appear before quotation marks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a bug in ewiki+, but a misconfiguration of the PHP interpreter.
Older versions still have the dumb "magic_quotes_gpc" setting enabled in the
"php.ini". Ask your provider to change this (disabled per default since PHP
version 4.2).

As workaround it is recommended to ALWAYS load the "plugins/lib/fix.php"
script. This will remove the backslashes from the mangled input, and won't
hurt otherwise.


Where can I switch the LANGUAGE for the »!ErfurtWiki«?
------------------------------------------------------

NoWhere! It depends on the settings of your browser. Every browser sends
a list of preferred languages with every request. ewiki+ automatically
checks for this and chooses the most appropriate translations. (Of course
it is possible to hard-wire a certain language.)

You could use the plugin "linking/tcn" to let it automatically switch
between pages in a multi-lingual Wiki.


TABLES and link TITLES
----------------------

The dash syntax for giving titles to links, of course clashes with the
markup for tables.

To work around this, and also because it looks nicer, you can use the
alternative syntax with quotation marks:

   ["quotes around the title" ExtendedWikiMarkup]


The default LAYOUT doesn't look so nice
---------------------------------------

All the example layouts distributed with the main ewiki tarball aren't
quite good-looking. There is always too little time to spend it on that,
and then this is also to encourage people to use their own layouts.

You can go to http://oswd.org/ and get ideas or templates from there. Or
download our ewiki extra tarball or the layouts from the WebInstaller on
http://ewiki.berlios.de/installer/layouts/


I want side PANELS and an editable MENU
---------------------------------------

Only few of the default/example layouts come with portal-script like
features. But you can have a look into fragments/blocks/ if you are
looking for some fancy feature.

ewiki doesn't care too much about your site layout, it only emits the
inner body part (with the Wiki page and controls). What else you want to
have on your pages is hardly controlled by it - that's the major design
constraint and conceptual shortcoming here.


Spammers! Spammers! Spammers! I need help, quick!
-------------------------------------------------

Please read the doc/LinkSpammers file. We have prepared lots of
countermeasures.


Have authors listed with a name/page in addition to the IP address
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the domain of the "$ewiki_author" variable. If you want your users
to set their names themselves (so your scripts don't need to do that), you
can use the "plugins/edit/authorname" plugin for example. The ProtectedMode
plugins provide similar functionatility (though that's overkill here).
There is even a WikiUserLogin page plugin.

! Remove

__Q:__ What for are the settings in "default settings are good settings - sometimes"?

__A:__ please see the README file, most configuration constants are explained there,
ask the author if something is unmentioned and unclear or annoying.
As ewiki.php can be included() in very different environments these 
settings may allow you to integrate it more sane and nicely. However
usually the distributed settings are very __ok__.



! no errors, but nothing happens

__Q:__ There is no database-mistake, but I can't see or edit all files. 
what's the reason?

__A:__ In the current release: go to ewiki.php and make a "echo mysql_error();"
in function "ewiki_database" before "return;". This might help to localise
the problems :-)
Reasons can be very different, so feel free to contact the author for support (icq95596825, mail: mario@erphesfurt.de).
