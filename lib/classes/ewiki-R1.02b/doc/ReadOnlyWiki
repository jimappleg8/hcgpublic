If you want a read-only Wiki for the public, then there is an easy method
with which you can do that without having to use any ewiki ProtectedMode
plugins.

You just create two "wrappers". One which allows doesn't allow write
access, and a second which does (with prior HTTP login then of course).
There is also a section in the README which explains this.


a locked personal Wiki, without ProtectedMode
---------------------------------------------

Using a Wiki to create a personal homepage is of course also possible. It is
just a convinience to use the easy Wiki technics as backend, instead of a
bloated and complicated CMS like PhpNuke or so.

It was also possible to add an overall Wiki lock, and then to afterwards
some pages as _WRITEABLE by the public. Though currently that code 
(see ==plugings/auth/perm_old.php==) is still to be overhauled.

-----

The ==ewiki.php== script basically is some sort of library, and it is
possible to build multiple frontends to your Wiki (like the scripts in our
examples/ directory). This not only allows to have multiple layouts
available, but also to have each with a different feature set.

A ''different feature set'' then could also mean, that you have one wrapper
for the public (which for example wouldn't allow editing), and a second for
yourself, which did (but then required a password; see also
[fragments/funcs/auth.php]). This is useful, if you want a PersonalWiki.


a sample public wrapper, that forbids editing
---------------------------------------------

<code>
<?php
   define("EWIKI_SCRIPT", "public.php?id=");
   include("config.php");
   // or   include("ewiki.php");

   #-- disallow some stuff, you wouldn't want visitors to do
   unset($ewiki_plugins["action"]["edit"]);
   unset($ewiki_plugins["action"]["info"]);
?>
...
<body>
  <?php
       #-- output page content
       echo ewiki_page();  
  ?>
</body>
...
</code>

Often you would want to call this (see EWIKI_SCRIPT) file then "index.php"
instead.



your unrestricted personal wrapper
----------------------------------

The wrapper which allows editing of course should be protected with a login.

<code>
<?php
   define("EWIKI_SCRIPT", "admin.php?id=");
   include("config.php");  // or   include("ewiki.php");
   #-- add some admin stuff
   include("plugins/admin/page_searchandreplace.php");
   #-- require a password
   include("fragments/funcs/auth.php");
?>
...
<?php
   echo ewiki_page();
?>
...
</code>

Please note, the different setting for EWIKI_SCRIPT here. It is not
necessary to keep the name "admin.php" script secret, because it is
already protected by HTTP auth (see the ==.../auth.php== script).
