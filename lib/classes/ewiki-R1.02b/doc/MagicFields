There are a few special database {meta} field names used thoughout ewiki
and its plugins. This description tries to collect and summarize them.


$meta["class"]          groups db entry / page into technical categories,
                        "temp", "calendar", "cache", "plugin", ...

$meta["kill-after"]     entry which shall be removed after given date
                        automatically (by cron.d/ scripts), used for
                        temporary and cache entries, just a time() value
