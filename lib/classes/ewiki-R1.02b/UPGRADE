There are only minor incompatibilities in the R1.02 series of ewiki. (Two
renamed plugins.)

If you updated from R1.01c or earlier, then use the "tools/upgrade-101d"
to convert the plugin file names in your 'config.php' file. It also works
for later versions and is supposed to collect all future changes (= never
hurts to run it).
