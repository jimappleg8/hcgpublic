patUser Installation
====================

CAUTION! 
patUser <= version 2.1.x are based on patDbc. Now patDbc is obsolete
- see http://www.php-tools.de/site.php?file=misc/patDbc.xml for details.
Further releases of patUser - version 2.2.0 and above - are based on PEAR::DB
which allows to access different types of datasources (MySQL, Postgres, ...)
Therefore currently all pat-classes switch to PEAR::DB. 

Release notes:
==============
Version 2.2.2 BETA:
- Added better security when using "crypt" encryption. 
- Added "mode" to requireAuthentication() - patUser now supports callback-objects to handle login
- removed some notices
- review of modifyUser() and fixed "username/password requirede"-bugs - hopefully!

Thanks to:
- Paul Baranowski <paul@paulbaranowski.org> who sends us a completely rewritten version of patUser 
  that implements lots of additional features and improvements. This version of patUser implements two of them 
  (improved crypt-function, callback for authentication).
- Gregor Gramlich <gramlich@eosc.de> for testing, reporting bugs and solutions.
- and YOU, for download, usage, test, bugreports, support, ...

Version 2.2.1:
- most changes were made to improve the download package
- minor bugfixes and removed notices

Version 2.2.0:
- derived from 2.1.1
- all functions changed to use work with PEAR:DB
- removed lots of warnings and notices
- patUser also works without "permissions" (uses only "groups" and "users")
- getPermissions() now can return a permission list of all users/groups

Installation:
=============
Installing these example are quite easy.

- Setup your Database
  patUsers stores all data in tables of your database. Use the SQL-dumps to setup the needed tables.
  
  This package provides two sets of SQL-dumps.
  
  1) sql/simple.sql
  This SQL-dump contains a very basic setup for patUser. It includes table definitions for "users", "groups", "permissions" and "usergroups"
  and four users: "gerd" (password: "gerd123"), "tom", "heiko" and "mathias" (Guess what the passwords are :-)).
  
  I suggest to use this "simple" setup for your first steps with patUser.
  
  2) sql/complex_*.sql
  There are some SQL-dumps named complex_base.sql, complex_users.sql and so on. Even if they are called "complex" 
  they are not really complicated. They are just dumps whose may come close to a real-live application. 
  The file complex_base.sql contains the basic table definitions, the oter files can be used for inserting
  data into you tables. I split the dump to ease playing with different data in your tables.
  
  Use any DB-Client (like "mysql" or "phpMyAdmin") to import the SQL-dump.
  
  Notes about SQL-Dumps:
  The SQL-dumps work fine in my case - but maybe you need to adjust the SQL-files if you use a different
  version of MySQL. If you have any suggestions to improve the SQL-dumps: please contact us/me!
  Please also notice, that I've never tested the dumps on other databases (like Postgres, etc). Furthermore I don't
  plan to test these dumps on any other database than the one I use. (I don't want to spend time for that.)
  On the other hand, if you send me fixed SQL-dumps I'll include them in the package. 

  
- copy files
  Copy the complete directory patUser into your web-root. 

- configure your installation of patUser
  patUser needs access to you database - of course. Therefore you have to setup your database-connection
  
  1) use exmaple.php and example2.php
  Open "prepend.php" and change $dsn to you needs. E.g.: mysql://pat:pat123@localhost/pat
  (see the documentation of PEAR:DB on http://pear.php.net)
  
  2) use example_patConfiguration.php 
  Open the xml-config-file: "conf/user.xml" and change the 
  values of the "userdsn"-tag e.g. mysql://pat:pat123@localhost/pat
   
- Start the example
  Start your web-browser and start the example:
  
  example.php - the basic example which is recommended
  
  example_patConfiguration.php - an example that shows how patUser can be configured with patConfiguration
  (This is just for advanced usage of patUsers)
  
  example_getPermissions.php - this example tests the improved features of the getPermission-method
  (Please notice, that you need some permissions in your database in order to fetch them!)
  
- start coding
  Load the example-files into your favourit editor and use patUser within your own projects.
