This is a language which applies formatting rules (color and size) to text
and which can be used to insert [HyperLink]s into it. HTML is __not__ a
programming language.

Inside a [Wiki|WikiWikiWeb] HTML is usually disallowed (Wiki:WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml),
so the <HTML> tags will show up as ordinary text and thus cannot be used to
encolor text or annoy other people.
