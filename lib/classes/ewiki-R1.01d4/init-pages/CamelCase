CamelCase describes rather nice what [WikiWord]s look like. Uppercase and
lowercase letters show up like the humps of camels.

This linking scheme is often also called !BumbyText.

While language purists hate Wikis for that naming scheme, it is on the other
hand very common in the computing world and well known to most programmers.
