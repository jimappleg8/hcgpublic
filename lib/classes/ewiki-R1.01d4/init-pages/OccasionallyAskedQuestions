! Language settings

__Q:__ Where can you switch the language for the »!ErfurtWiki«?

__A:__ Nowhere! It depends on the settings of your browser. In more recent
browsers there is a way to define your preferred languages (yes, you can
tell your browser which language you like most, and what other languages are
acceptable).



! Remove

__Q:__ What for are the settings in "default settings are good settings - sometimes"?

__A:__ please see the README file, most configuration constants are explained there,
ask the author if something is unmentioned and unclear or annoying.
As ewiki.php can be included() in very different environments these 
settings may allow you to integrate it more sane and nicely. However
usually the distributed settings are very __ok__.



! no errors, but nothing happens

__Q:__ There is no database-mistake, but I can't see or edit all files. 
what's the reason?

__A:__ In the current release: go to ewiki.php and make a "echo mysql_error();"
in function "ewiki_database" before "return;". This might help to localise
the problems :-)
Reasons can be very different, so feel free to contact the author for support (icq95596825, mail: mario@erphesfurt.de).




! Bad Backslashes

__Q:__ I installed ErfurtWiki which is a very easy to use and efficient wiki
but whenever I type ' or \ in the edit page it ouputs \' and \\. I am
using last version of ErfurtWiki R1.00d2 on Apache 1.3 under win32 ?

__A:__ This is not a bug in ErfurtWiki, Win32 or Apache, but a PHP configuration
error in the __php.ini__. You should disable the __magic_quotes_gpc__ setting
or include the fragments/strip_wonderful_slashes.php workaround script for
servers you don't have access to the php.ini. In most cases this fixes
that problem. -- milky



! dash sign link titles and tables

__Q__: Links with vertical bars within tables glitch like this:
%%%
==| ~[test link | http://www.yahoo.com/] |==

__A__: Use the  new link entitling
scheme using ~["double quotes" ExtendedWikiMarkup] to avoid this.  Double
quotes is no WikiStandard and very specific to ErfurtWiki but handy.



! Feature Requests

__Q:__ Is it possible to have a page author listed with a name (perhaps as a
WikiWord) in addition to the IP address?

__A:__ The ewiki.php core script respects the "$ewiki_author" variable 
and would write this into that author field of a saved wiki page (besides
the usual IP address).
  It additionally respects the HTTP "From:" field (like the anonymous-ftp
password), that however none of the current browsers supports - personally I
use a patched 'w3m' which actually does ;) so my changes usually carry my
email address.

However the example "yoursite.php" scripts distributed in the 
tarball do not set the $ewiki_author variable. But it __is__
possible to add this in your wikis layout script (yoursite.php).
And there is in fact already a plugin to do that. Please see the README file
or the plugins/ directore for page_wikiuserlogin.

! editable menu

[anonymous]: The main menu is not available for editing. There should be a
link for editing the main menue too. The menu page should be integrated into
the ErfurtWiki!

[MarioSalzer "milky"]: Once again, the "ErfurtWiki" is a library, neither
a menu or a specific page layout belongs to it. What you can see here is the
example-1 wrapper around the ewiki script, you really need your own layout
to do that. However a "MainMenu" has now been integrated into the distributed
example-1 wrapper (experimentally).


! New default layout uncompatible with Konqueror Browser

With the new style (since july'03) the ewiki default layout causes the
menus to be displayed on very right of page in Konqueror browser (3.0.4).
Probabely problem w/ table-tag. Maybe the same mistake causes main part of
page when using the ''nuke''-layout to be displayed very wide (same
browser). -- MassenMensch

[MarioSalzer "milky"]: It looks as it should in all my Mozilla versions, and
it also works in Opera and IE (less nicely of course). The Konqueror really
breaks thinks a bit (has problems with the "float:" as I figured out).
However the menu on the right side is a good thing and intended to be there,
it is more comfortable for lynx- and screenreader-users.

["APF"  AndyFundinger]:  It sounds like you are describing the intended
look.  Personally I'm not sure it's an improvement but it is usable and I
expect most users design their own layout anyway.

["I" MarioSalzer] hope they do, this is the reason that lead to the new
layout.

[anonymous]: sorry, but looks like hell in Safari.

["milky" MarioSalzer]: That's because of their KHTML (KDE WebCore) rendering
engine. It has some trouble with CSS layouts (which utilize the "float:"
thingi to work completely without tables), see Konqueror notes above.
