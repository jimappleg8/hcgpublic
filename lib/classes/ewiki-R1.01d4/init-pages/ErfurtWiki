ErfurtWiki is implemented in the PHP scripting language and mainly contained
in one script file. It was implemented more like a library and thus allows
very quick integration into existing web sites, also because it does not
enforce a specific page layout or requires you to chose from a few factory
page themes/skins. See the FeatureList or SoftwareNotes for what it can do.
