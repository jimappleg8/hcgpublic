A WikiWikiWeb allows its users to quickly and easy add or change
pages. Its best use is for collecting informations to one very
specific subject to build a powerful knowledge base. But without
contributors or editorial staff it won't be a very useful tool.

You can of course use it for other less scientific jobs too:
* lite content management for a private homepage 
* as GuestBook
* personal online NotePad
* instead of a forum / message board

For informations on how to contribute read the notes about how to
CreatePages and the summary of available WikiMarkup, then try out
the EditThisPage link on the bottom of the SandBox, NotePad or
GuestBook.

! Serious concerns about the open approach

Of course if someone runs a page where really everybody can change things,
there are also some risks you should be aware of, if you'd like to use it
for your site.

While there are many contributors adding useful notes and information to
a wiki there can be also some black sheeps, which annoy others or delete
content in the hope that random deletion could bring some fun to their life.
Even if it is rather easy to bring back lost content due to the unremovable
version history, this can be a lot of effort because of the amount of free
time 5th grade pupils usually have.

Therefor you should know how to prevail people upon keeping nice most
of the time. Restricting a wiki with some sort of authentication mechanism,
which enforces users to register before they're allowed to do anything, would
really hurt the whole concept; you should then rather try
[PhpNuke|http://phpnuke.org/] or a similar portal software.
