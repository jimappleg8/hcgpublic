Just type what comes to your mind. There is no need to spend time
on imaginizing how it will show up later (and if it doesn't look nice
it's probably not your fault, most often that's caused by a bug in
the software).

Signing your thoughts might sometimes be a good idea, too. At least if
you write in the first person you should do so.

Even if this is not the [IRC|irc://#irchelp] or a Board/Newsgroup, you are
really allowed to be talkative.

If you can't finish a text, somebody else may do it later. Don't care.

Please don't strip off text and comments somebody else has written, create a
new page and fill it with your own opinion. Also don't go around and annoy
others; internet technology allows to get your address.


! Comments

If you choose to comment on somebody elses thoughts (or just to extend an
existing text) it is sometimes a good thing to insert a horizontal break
(-----) before you insert your additions. More import is often to insert your
name before or after your comment.

<pre>
~YourName:
  ... your comment to the
  previous paragraphs ...
</pre>

Doing so, discussions usually look more living, and different opinions do
not screw up or confuse readers.
