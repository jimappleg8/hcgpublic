* you can do whatever you want with it
* and you do not need to pay for it.
* there is however no right to receive the source code if you demand it (this GPL rule is obviously senseless for PHP programs, as these can only incarnate as source code)

Actually this is like FreeWare, despite the fact that the author explicitly
dropped all otherwise existing applicable rights on it. This however makes
this even more illegal than the GPL in states like Germany which enforce
people to take advantage of their "intellectual property rights", if they
want it or not.
