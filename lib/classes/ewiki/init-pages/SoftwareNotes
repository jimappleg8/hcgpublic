This page tries to collect some stuff, that did not fit into the ~ChangeLog
and README files, but are worth a note.


! known bugs and problems

* the current database abstraction layer (namely the SEARCH and GETALL actions) are very memory exhaustive, and need a redesign (iterative db query, object abstraction)
* syntax for inner page anchors is likely to change
* <pre> markup still does not prevent ~WikiLinks from getting rendered, this will require a complete rewrite of the rendering kernel
* non-ASCII characters in some page names reportedly may yield problems in some cases
* CSS markup is underway, please see the discussion on our [project site|http://erfurtwiki.sf.net/]
* page names with "&" inside still cause problems in generated lists (NewestPages for example), even if ewiki_script() is used now


! HTML validity

While the code produced by this wiki engine is rather good and senseful
it is not 100% valid. It works in most browsers, but

* [w3c tidy|http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/] doesn't like the <p> and </p> tags which enclose paragraphs, however I think it is correct that way
* the [dillo|http://dillo.auriga.wearlab.de/] webbrowser has problems with the </p> behind headlines and thus closes opened tables (while it works quite well with other gtkhtml deprived browsers)
* finally the sublists should get enclosed in <li> ... </li> too, but until anybody complains this won't be changed

It looks as desired in:
* all [Mozilla|http://mozilla.org/] variants (including [Netscape|http://netscape.com/] 6/7)
* Opera 5, 6 and 7
* amaya - the reference browser implementation from http://w3c.org/
* Netscape 4
* w3m
* links
* Konqueror
* Windows Netscape 2.01 and Netscape 1.1 (W32s)
* M$IE 4+


! Compatibility to !PhpWiki

The database table structure of ErfurtWiki is compatible to the one used by
PhpWiki:, however it is rather untested if you can reuse them. Especially
changing back from !ErfurtWiki to !PhpWiki is eventually not possible.


! Compatibility regarding WikiMarkup

* !ErfurtWiki only implements parts of the new style markup
* older markup (tabs to the left) will not work and it won't get implemented
* the uploaded images are represented using internal:// references which are obviously invalid protocol identifiers, therefor you should strip them off if you reuse your wiki pages with another wiki software


! desigin limitations

* The database backend has been enhanced to gracefully pass previous memory problems, it however still works in a buffered mode. So the maximum number of possible pages (the point until most functionality remains intact) is around 172000 now (estimated assuming 5MB memory and an average page name strlen of 20).


! random notes

* 23% of the core script are comments and whitespace things (it are about 31% when measured in byte size)
