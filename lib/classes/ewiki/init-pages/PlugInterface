! A general pluginterface

The main [PHP|http://php.net/] script of ErfurtWiki contains everything
necessary to run a wiki site (except the html around which make up your
sites` layout). However at some point of its development the extensions
got too large to be included into the core without hurting speed. So from
now non-essential but powerful extensions can be added (using just PHPs
include() statement) into the engine through the new __pluginterface__,
which is surprisingly just a simple array structure listing the
extension functions.

Please see the [README|http://erfurtwiki.sourceforge.net/README] for more
informations about it.

! The mpi plugins

Another extension are the ''mpi plugins'' which themselves utilize the general
pluginterface to chain into the page transformation process to extend it 
with wiki markup that allows dynamic content.
