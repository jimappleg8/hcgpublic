This site runs »!ErfurtWiki«, which is an implementation of the WikiWikiWeb
hypertext system. It allows everybody who comes along to edit and create
new pages very easily.

* read the WikiHowto if you'd like to know what this can be used for
* learn how to CreatePages
* click on [[EditThisPage]] to change the contents of a page
* make friends with WikiMarkup
* visit the [GuestBook|ErfurtWiki:GuestBook] or the SandBox and NotePad to play with it
* SearchPages or go to the list of NewestPages
* there are also lists of the MostVisitedPages, MostOftenChangedPages and recently UpdatedPages

ErfurtWiki is implemented in the PHP scripting language and fully
contained in one script file. It was implemented more like a library and thus
allows very quick integration into existing web sites, because it does not
enforce a specific page layout or requires you to chose from factory page
themes/skins.

Other cool features are:
* the new PlugInterface that allows to extend ''ewiki'' µµ(internal project name)µµ while keeping the core small (just one script).
* it has a very easy ImageUploading function
* caches referenced images 
* can work with a MySQL database or without (using the flat files backend)
* external administration tools are available
* besides all this it is rather fast (using mainly simple string arithmetics to render wiki pages)
* plugins for example provide the PageIndex or the ImageGallery and the !LikePages feature
