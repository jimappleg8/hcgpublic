You really should learn what the basic WikiMarkup can do for you, before you
start to read about more complex features.


!! Image markup

Images can be inlined into a page using square brackets around the absolute
www-address of the image file, like ![http://www/image.png].

To align an image (define how the following text flows around it) one 
can add space characters inside the square brackets before and/or after
its !http://-address:
** text flows around on the right ![http://example.com/image.png  ]
** left aligned image ![  http://example.com/image.png]
** with spaces on the left and right, a image will display centred

One can also specify to which size a image shall be rescaled by the browser,
if this is added as parameters with a query string like appendation; for
example ![http://www.example.com/image.png?x=200&y=100] would scale the
image to 200 pixels width and 100 pixels height. One can also use width= and
height= parameters to do so.

If you do not want an image to get inlined into the current page, then just
leave out the square brackets around its URL.


!! footnotes

To create a footnote {{ a footnote can contain additional information snippets}}
use double curly brackets. Usually creating a new page to explain something
in more detail is a much better approach, so the footnotes extension is a
plugin in ErfurtWiki and thus not available per default.


!! Links

* a WikiWord will form a hyperlink
* any valid www-address like http://www.example.com/ will do too
* many nonvalid addresses will do too, see file://localhost/etc/passwd
* [square brackets around text] makes a hyperlink
** adding (more) [[square brackets around it]] is more [[[[intuitive]]]] than with other wikis
** a ![title | for square bracket links ] can be added using the | character
*** the title should be on the left to the linked WikiWord
*** but for ewiki it can be on either side, because a http://www can be easily distinguished
** a !["title" for square bracket links] can also be assigned using quotation marks
*** the title inside the quotation marks can be on either side of the !["..." wiki link] or ![http:// "URL"]
*** you can use this too for image links
*** this scheme is useful, but incompatible with other !WikiSoftware
* the ! exclamation mark or the tilde ~ can be used to escape a !!WikiWord or a !!http://www.address.net/ and of course escapes !![square brackets] as easily
** this is more understandable than escaping with "[" like in other wikis (like [PhpWiki|PhpWiki:])
* instead of square brackets, one may utilize the ^ character to make a ^^wikilink of !NotBumpyWords


!! Anchors

Instead of linking from page to page, one can also create inner page links
using so called anchors. Anchors are defined and referenced using the hash
sign inside before square brackets. #![anchorname] for example creates an
anchor, to reference it one must put both the hash sign and the anchor name
inside the square brackets, like [#anchorname].


Requiring a pagename in front of the anchor name to reference to it is some
overhead but the only senseful way to create valid links. So to create
links to an anchor on the current page one must write ![CurrentPage#anchor].

Anchors and anchor references can and should also be entitled using
quotation marks or the dash sign:
* #![anchor "Title for this anchor"].
* ![#anchor2 "anchor2 jump link title"]
<!-- note: the "!" is only in fornt of the brackets here, to show you how the wikisource code should look like



!! Lists

* one can create lists by writing an asterisk at the beginning of a line
*# or enumerated lists by using a hash sign instead
** instead of the asterisk the - minus character can be used sometimes
** definition lists can be created using :: or ;: at the line start or as sublist
**:definition: explanation
**:anotherdef: another description


!! Paragraphs

* lists automatically make up a new paragraph
* every block of text (without empty lines) will form a paragraph

Text can be indented using TABs or spaces at the beginning of a line:

      You'll need at least three spaces to make indentation. One TAB has
      the width of eight spaces, but you cannot enter them in mainstream
      browsers.
	 You can mix indendation levels and thus structure your text very
         easily and intuitve.
      But note, that indendation will only be visible in newer browser
      versions (because this feature havily relies upon style sheets for
      the actua paragraph layout).

>> You can right align text by using two grater-than characters
>> at the beginning of a line.


!! PRE-formatted text

<pre>
   If  you  wish  text  to  appear "pre-formatted" then
 all you have to do is to start that paragraph using
    the code "<pre>" at the line start. End that
  paragraph again by writing "</pre>" at the beginning
of a line.
</pre>

Most people will already know that markup, as it is a plain <HTML> tag, and
so will feel very comfortable with it. But note that "<pre>" and "</pre>"
must be written in all-lowercase, else it won't apply! 


!! Text style

* text can be made __bold__ or **bold**
* or ''italic''
* ##big## and 도small도
* up^^set^^
* ==typewriter== like font

But there exist equivalents in old style WikiMarkup:

* '''bold'''
* '''''bold and italic'''''

And ##most## of 도these도 things **can** be __''combined''__.


!! HTML comments

* HTML-comments can be inserted using a <!-- at a line start, but __don't__ add the --> as it will be appended automatically and would appear as text
* use this trick to hide informations from plain visitors (only somebody who edits a page can read comments)


!! !!InterWiki:Links

* there exist abbreviations for concurrent wikis on the web
* to reference a page from another wiki, just prepend the Wikis name and a colon before the remote !WikiPageName:
** ErfurtWiki:ErfurtWiki
** Wiki:WikiClones
** Wiki:InterWiki
* that's why you shouldn't use the colon inside of square brackets



!! mpi plugins from Hans B. Pufal

The ''mpi plugins'' utilize the general PlugInterface to extend the ewiki
markup with <html> tag like references to generate dynamic content. You must
first include("plugins/mpi.php") and all the desired modules to use them.

<?plugin: plugins?>

<?plugin: insert !WorldWideWeb?>

<?plugin: calendar?>

If you can't see anything special above this, then the according mpi plugins
are probably disabled.
