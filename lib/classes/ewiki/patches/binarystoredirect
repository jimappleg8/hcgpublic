If you use the plugins/binary_store.php to save binary file outside of the
SQL or dbff database, and you additonally store those plain files at a
location which is accessible via your webserver, then you will find it
useful to let ewiki generate URLs directly to there.
This means binary stuff like images is kept separate from the database and
can thus be accessed by the http clients directly. If you however direct
them directly to the stored files, you will loose some advantages of the
ewiki ?binary= code, like the Content-Type headers for example (you should
work around that by telling your webserver to utilize mime_magic for all
files in that binary_store directory).


- edit ewiki.php
- find the "function ewiki_script_binary("
- add after the line "$url = ewiki_script(..." following:

      if (!$upload) {
        $url = "http://www.mywikiserver.net/wiki/files/binary_store/"
               . rawurlencode($id);
      }

- fin

The above example assumes, that you directed the "binary_store" plugin to
save your binary files as is in the "/wiki/files/binary_store/" subdirectory
(see also your personal EWIKI_DB_STORE_DIRECTORY).

This is an example and will not work if you do copy&paste. The author
provides no support for this patch.
